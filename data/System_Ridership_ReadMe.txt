Some notes regarding the data.
 
CTA: Starting in 1997, CTA rail ridership includes rail-to-rail transfers, making CTA rail ridership figures before and after 1997 not comparable.
Metra: The agency has purchase of service agreements with two railroads, Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) and Union Pacific (UP), which assumed service from the Chicago & North Western (C&NW) in 1995.  For consistency, BNSF and C&NW ridership data prior to 1995 has been included in Metraâ€™s annual ridership data.
ADA Paratransit: These services were operated by CTA prior to 2007; since 2007, Pace has operated regional paratransit service.
